# Immich ML: tiered GPU scheduling

> **Cluster reality (validated 2026-10-10 against the live cluster)**
>
> - `k3s-node1` (Intel 46d1, Alder Lake-S UHD770): `gpu.intel.com/i915=1` OK.
> - `k3s-worker-z690` (i915 render node present): was not advertising i915
>   because `/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins` was owned by uid 100000, so the
>   unprivileged plugin pod crashed on socket bind (`permission denied`).
>   Fixed with `sudo chown root:root /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins` on the
>   node + pod restart. The node was also cordoned; it has been uncordoned.
> - `k3s-server-nuc`: it is a VM exposing only a Red Hat Virtio GPU to the
>   guest (DRIVER=virtio-pci). The UHD660 lives on the VM host and is NOT
>   visible to k3s, so this node cannot host a GPU ML pod today. Until iGPU
>   passthrough/SR-IOV or a host-level k3s move is done, only 2 GPU slots
>   exist and a 3rd ML replica will stay Pending.
> - `k3s-server-hp-g9`: also a virtio VM; carries the stale
>   `intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu=true` label despite having no usable
>   GPU. Harmless (no i915 capacity), but the label is misleading.
>
> HPA maxReplicas stays at 3 so the fleet self-heals to 3 replicas as soon as
> the third GPU slot appears.

## Node tags (applied live on 2026-10-10; script kept for re-apply)

| Node                | `immich.ml/tier` | `immich.ml/gpu-model` | Notes                          |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| k3s-node1           | 1                | uhd770                | iGPU, OpenVINO via Level Zero  |
| k3s-server-nuc      | 1                | uhd660                | iGPU, OpenVINO via Level Zero  |
| k3s-worker-z690     | 1                | uhd770                | iGPU, OpenVINO via Level Zero  |
| k3s-server-hp-g9    | 2                | none                  | CPU only, LAST priority        |

`immich.ml/tier` is the scheduling tag used by the deployment affinity.
`immich.ml/gpu-model` is informational, for `kubectl get nodes -L` visibility
and future model-aware scheduling.

## Scheduling rules (machine-learning.yaml)

1. **Hard requirement**: node must carry `immich.ml/tier` in {1, 2}, OR (grace
   window before tagging is applied) the Intel device plugin GPU feature label
   `intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu=true`.
2. **Soft preference**: `tier=1` nodes are weighted 100 vs 10 for `tier=2`, so
   CPU (`k3s-server-hp-g9`) is only ever picked when no GPU node is feasible.
3. **Spread**: soft pod anti-affinity on `kubernetes.io/hostname` plus the
   topology spread constraint keep replicas on distinct nodes. The
   `gpu.intel.com/i915: 1` limit (1 iGPU per node) enforces this hard anyway.
4. **CPU fallback caveat**: because every pod requests `gpu.intel.com/i915: 1`,
   a pod cannot actually schedule on the GPU-less hp-g9. The tier=2 affinity is
   future-proofing: to genuinely run ML there (CPU via OpenVINO), drop the
   `i915` limit and the `/dev/dri` + Level Zero hostPath mounts, and set
   `MACHINE_LEARNING_DEVICE=CPU` (e.g. a dedicated CPU-only deployment or a
   kustomize overlay). Keeping the limit is recommended so GPU slots are never
   silently degraded to CPU under load.

## HPA rules (machine-learning-hpa.yaml)

- `minReplicas: 1`, `maxReplicas: 3`: ceiling = 3 tier=1 nodes x 1 iGPU each.
  Scaling past 3 can only create Pending pods.
- Metrics: CPU 75% and memory 80% utilization (max of the two triggers scale).
- Scale up: aggressive (up to 100% / +1 pod per 15s, no stabilization) to fill
  all three GPU slots quickly during smart-search / face-detection bursts.
- Scale down: conservative (1 pod per 60s after 300s stabilization) since GPU
  model loading is expensive and flapping wastes inference time.
