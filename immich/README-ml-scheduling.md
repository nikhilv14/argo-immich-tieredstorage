# Immich ML: tiered GPU scheduling

## Node tags (apply with `label-ml-nodes.sh`)

| Node                | `immich.ml/tier` | `immich.ml/gpu-model` | Notes                          |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| k3s-node1           | 1                | uhd770                | iGPU, OpenVINO via Level Zero  |
| k3s-server-nuc      | 1                | uhd660                | iGPU, OpenVINO via Level Zero  |
| k3s-worker-z690     | 1                | uhd770                | iGPU, OpenVINO via Level Zero  |
| k3s-server-hp-g9    | 2                | none                  | CPU only, LAST priority        |

`immich.ml/tier` is the scheduling tag used by the deployment affinity.
`immich.ml/gpu-model` is informational, for `kubectl get nodes -L` visibility
and future model-aware scheduling.

## Scheduling rules (machine-learning.yaml)

1. **Hard requirement**: node must carry `immich.ml/tier` in {1, 2}, OR (grace
   window before tagging is applied) the Intel device plugin GPU feature label
   `intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu=true`.
2. **Soft preference**: `tier=1` nodes are weighted 100 vs 10 for `tier=2`, so
   CPU (`k3s-server-hp-g9`) is only ever picked when no GPU node is feasible.
3. **Spread**: soft pod anti-affinity on `kubernetes.io/hostname` plus the
   topology spread constraint keep replicas on distinct nodes. The
   `gpu.intel.com/i915: 1` limit (1 iGPU per node) enforces this hard anyway.
4. **CPU fallback caveat**: because every pod requests `gpu.intel.com/i915: 1`,
   a pod cannot actually schedule on the GPU-less hp-g9. The tier=2 affinity is
   future-proofing: to genuinely run ML there (CPU via OpenVINO), drop the
   `i915` limit and the `/dev/dri` + Level Zero hostPath mounts, and set
   `MACHINE_LEARNING_DEVICE=CPU` (e.g. a dedicated CPU-only deployment or a
   kustomize overlay). Keeping the limit is recommended so GPU slots are never
   silently degraded to CPU under load.

## HPA rules (machine-learning-hpa.yaml)

- `minReplicas: 1`, `maxReplicas: 3`: ceiling = 3 tier=1 nodes x 1 iGPU each.
  Scaling past 3 can only create Pending pods.
- Metrics: CPU 75% and memory 80% utilization (max of the two triggers scale).
- Scale up: aggressive (up to 100% / +1 pod per 15s, no stabilization) to fill
  all three GPU slots quickly during smart-search / face-detection bursts.
- Scale down: conservative (1 pod per 60s after 300s stabilization) since GPU
  model loading is expensive and flapping wastes inference time.
